# Flare for Airplane

Hello! Thank you for checking out this repo, although it's rather bad right now.
The parsing code is flaky and poorly written, and the task controllers aren't great.
As well, I'd like to eventually abstract out any Airplane specific things and make this a more generic tool.

The `jfr` branch contains the code that parses the JFR format instead of the text format, and is my goal longer term.
